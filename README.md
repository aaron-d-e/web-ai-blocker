# AI web blocker extension - "Monkey Lock"

![Monkey Lock](images/monkey8.png)

I found myself often accepting the first answer thrown at me via the AI overview when looking up something. This led to an increase in imposter syndrome and I wanted something to remove the temptation. This extension is a silly little remedy to that. It blocks the AI overview from appearing on your browser when you search. It also blocks all mainstream AI chat websites and feeds you a monkey meme, locking you out of the site (Monkey Lock). To turn it off, there's a toggle switch in the extension popup, but you should feel dirty and gross as you turn slide that switch. Instead of accepting any answer that AI shoves at you, laugh at a monkey meme and read the damn docs. 

## Currently blocks access to:
- ChatGPT
- Gemini
- Google AI
- OpenAI
- Co-pilot
- Claude
- Perplexity (currently having problems getting this one to work for some reason)

## Supported Browser (at least the tested ones)
